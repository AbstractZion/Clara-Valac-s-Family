        <p id="p1"> Shown in the images above is Clara's family. They're all energitic and kind devils. Clara's brother (Urara), on the right is the serious one. He showed up in the series a few times during the episodes but only in pictures but then we meet him during the one of the last episodes.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p2">Clara's family has a bloodline ability to take anything out of their pockets which leads to her being manipulated at school, though she knows but acts happy. That's when Iruma first goes to school and meets her. She became his first friend and he helped her end the fake friendship between her and others. </p>
